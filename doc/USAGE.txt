This library is designed to work with jQuery. All library's components are designed to work
  with originally included software with no changes. Current library implements various
  patches to original jQuery code. These patches extend jQuery, for example, to support
  new jQuery-native event 'remove' for graceful cleanups.

It is very important that if you manipulate DOM you do that using jQuery API, no native DOM
  .innerHTML, appendChild, removeChild and like that, because jQuery manages new 'remove' event,
  that is not native to DOM, and the most of cleanup of this library is based on that event.
  If you ommit using jQuery's .remove() or .html() to manipulate DOM, various memory leaks may
  (actually - will) take place.
