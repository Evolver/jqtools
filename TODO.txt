- jQuery has bugs (or browsers have them?) with .width(), .height(), .innerWidth(), .innerHeight(), .outerWidth(),
   .outerHeight() on elements, when they are hidden. If element is hidden, computed values for the methods specified
   above are incorrect. To obtain correct values, element should be show()n first. So the process is the following:
   
     elem.show();
     var width =elem.outerWidth(true);
     elem.hide();// restore status of visibility
     
   Investigate those jQuery methods and see if those are browser-specific or jQuery's bugs.
   There are lots of stubs in current code to avoid these bugs. Those stubs to be removed when bug is resolved.
   
- Documentation for jQuery.textinput

- Documentation for jQuery.button

- Documentation for jQuery.checkbox

- Documentation for jQuery.textarea

- Finish menu documentation.

- Implement JSON validation in every place, where eval() takes place. This is needed to protect
    from potential data injection from server side.

- Rewrite native jQuery.ajax readystatechange code, it's a little bit messy.
