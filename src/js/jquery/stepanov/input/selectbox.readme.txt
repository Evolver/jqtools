Theory:

  jQuery.selectbox manages native browser select box customization through DOM manipulation.
  
  jQuery.selectbox(), when called on a SELECT element (further in text - original sbox), hides it,
  and appends right after that element a TABLE (further - custom sbox). Note, that original sbox
  is not being removed from DOM, it is being hidden. All events from custom sbox are being routed
  to original sbox, so, if you have any event handlers, like onclick, or onmouseover, on an original
  sbox, they will be triggered if user clicks a custom sbox or mouse overs it. Furthermore, when
  script is rendering menu/dialog/dropdown/overlay or whatever you decide to show your users as a
  tool of option selection, options are being taken directly from original sbox element.

  custom sbox markup, that is appended right after original sbox, is the following:
  
  <table class="<SELECT object's class name>">
  <tr class="top">
    <td class="left"></td>
    <td class="mid"></td>
    <td class="right"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="mid">
    <td class="left"></td>
    <td class="canvas">
      <div class="value"></div>  <-- this is the container of selected option's label/labels.
      <div class="menu"></div>   <-- this is dropdown/overlay/popup/whatever container. This container
                                      is used to display option selection dialog/whatever.
    </td>
    <td class="right"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="bot">
    <td class="left"></td>
    <td class="mid"></td>
    <td class="right"></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  
  table > tbody > tr.top, table > tbody > tr.mid and table > tbody > tr.bot are necessary to
  wrap the div.value in td.canvas from all sides to be able to give almost any look to the element.
  
  All the action is happening in tr.mid > div.canvas:
    div.value - current selected value or select value list container
    div.menu - object, that is shown when user clicks custom sbox
  
  To customize look of your custom sbox, for example, for this markup:
  
  <body>
    <select id="mySbox" class="customSelectbox">
      <option value="1" label="Opt #1: htmlspecialchars escaped html code to show">Opt #1: Text to show if no data in label</option>
    </select>
  </body>
  
  use, the following CSS get it done:
  
  /* customize overall custom select box element */
  body > table.customSelectbox {
  }
  /* customize wrapping parts of div.value */
  body > table.customSelectbox > tbody > ... {
  }
  /* customize 'value' zone */
  body > table.customSelectbox > tbody > tr.mid > td.canvas > div.value {
  }
  /* customize menu look */
  body > table.customSelectbox > tbody > tr.mid > td.canvas > div.menu {
  }
  
  For example, if you want to have an IE-like dropdown option selections, you have to assign
  position: relative to tr.mid > td.canvas, and assign position: absolute to div.menu so that
  menu when appears is positioned absolutely relative to td.canvas.
  
  jQuery.selectbox( Object options) accepts an object as optional parameter (further - options).
  
  available keys of options are the following:
  
    effect (optional) - what effect to use to show/hide div.menu object. Available values:
              jQuery.SELECTBOX_EFFECT_NONE - instant show/hide
              jQuery.SELECTBOX_EFFECT_FADE - fading effect
              jQuery.SELECTBOX_EFFECT_SLIDE_DOWN - slide down
              jQuery.SELECTBOX_EFFECT_SLIDE_OUT - slide out
              
    presentation (obligate) - object, containing the following keys:
      open - callback to call to show div.menu object
      close - callback to call to hide div.menu object
      
      Using presentation object you can pass any callbacks you want to render div.menu as
      you like. This callback system makes it possible to easy plug in to the core selectbox
      script plugins for custom div.menu object displaying.
      
    makeValue (optional) - callback to call for building of contents of div.value when an
                            option is selected or options are being checked. Using this callback
                            you can build any output to show in div.value zone basing on selected
                            options. This callback is called in context of original sbox, so
                            you can access options by this.options, and selected index (if select
                            box is not multiple) by this.selectedIndex. The callback should return
                            HTML code or text to insert into div.value object.

    jQuery.selectbox() should not be used directly to instantiate custom select box, jQuery.selectbox()
    is meant to be called by plugins that render custom div.menu layout. To use custom select box, find
    appropriate plugin, and call it's constructor, for example, if you have a native IE custom select box
    plugin under name nativeIeSelectbox, call jQuery(elements).nativeIeSelectbox({...});
    
    When a select box is opened, a 'opened' class is added to the TBODY element of custom sbox.
    What is the format of option storing in div.menu and how to track their "checkedness" is
    up to you.
    
    The following methods can be used to trigger necessary actions on custom sbox:
    
    jQuery.toggleSelectboxOption( /* DOMElement */ optionElement);
                            
minimal markup:

  No minimal markup. Script wraps native SELECT box elements.

usage:

  $( 'select#selectbox').customSelectbox({
  
    // use fading effect
    effect: jQuery.SELECTBOX_EFFECT_FADE
    
  });
