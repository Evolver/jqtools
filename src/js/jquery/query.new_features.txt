Added non-DOM-native event - remove. It is being triggered on each element, which is about to be
 removed from DOM. To handle 'remove' event, bind a listener on a desired element with .bind() to
 listen to event 'remove'. 'remove' event is triggered right before data associated to object is
 removed, so data is available during event handling.
